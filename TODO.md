- Ensure that GEMM is actually GEMM

[NEW_ISSUES_FOUND]
- [SEMI_BAD] worker_active_periods are not being calculated correctly (circular issue where I need to these times to know warm and cold starts but I only know them if I calculate worker times). Result: worker_active_periods assumes NO worker startup time
- In the start, planners assign worker ids randomly/first upstream worker id
    this is not optimal: for example, if task is on critical path it should have priority to use the same worker id as the CP upstream task
    requires: rethinking order of actions by the planner algorithm

- [TODO] Update dashboards:
    Compare SLAs ("global"):
    - success rate (percentage of workflows that finished below the SLA)
    - overall prediction success rate (compared to the real values)
    PreWarm ("individual"):
    - how many happened, which tasks had them
    Dup ("individual"):
    - how many happened, which tasks were dupped?

**1** | [DONE] `pre-warm` (an "empty" invocation (special message) to a **target resource config**)
    [A] a task that has this annotation, should prewarm `prewarmoptimization.targetResourceConfig` before it starts it's own input handling => execution => etc...
    when it receives this invocation, the FaaS engine will startup a container, run the "empty invocation" code path (could exit immediatelly), and then leave the environment running for a few more seconds (not controllable by us) in hope of another invocation (would be "warm")
    [A] when is it added by the planners?
        - for each node that is expected to be a "cold start", if a its worker configuration startup time represents more than 15% of the sum of execution times of tasks with same worker config that start AFTER this node, then that worker config should be prewarmed
            - Look at nodes before this node and find a node that could prewarm the worker config needed for this node without it becoming cold when I start
    possible benefits: faster startup times for some tasks on workers with a resource config for which there are not yet enough worker instances
    possible issues: to simulate this, I have to set "ALLOW_CONTAINER_REUSAGE=True", but this will make the experiments unfair because some startups will be warm

**2** | `task-dup` (to represent tasks that can be duplicated)
    - Use-case:
        if a W1 is waiting for the data of an upstream TA (executing or to be executed on worker 2) to be available, 
        it can execute that task itself (if certain conditions are met). . the results produced by W2 will be ignored by W1. 
    - Possible benefits: - makespan ; - data download time.
        W1 wonâ€™t need to wait for the data to be available and then download it from external storage.
        W2 may not need to upload the output to storage.
    - [A] Drawbacks:
        - double execution time (task MAY be executed twice)
        - double input download (target task inputs MAY be downloaded twice)
        - extra storage accesses to:
            - more completion events subscriptions (publishing already happened for all tasks, now we just have more consumers)
            - check duppable tasks startup times
            - check cancelation flag before **input grabbing**, **execution** and **output upload** (cost: resources, not latency)
            - check cancelation flag before **dupping** (to TRY avoid 2 workers dupping the same task)
            - the duppable.upstream tasks all need to send their outputs to storage because the "dupper" may need it
        - dupping may be CANCELLED because the dependencies for running the duppable task may not be available
    - [A] Implementation:
        - Before they start executing, duppable tasks will store a timestamp
        - For each task that has at least 1 upstream task that can be dupped (has annotation), subscribe to COMPLETION events of ALL upstream tasks (not just the duppable ones)
            - every time this event is fired:
                for each unfinished duppable task:
                    formula: 
                        expected_ready = start_time + pred_execution_time + pred_upload_time + pred_download_time
                        potential_ready = now + pred_download_time_locally + pred_execution_time_locally
                        if potential_ready + THRESHOLD < expected_ready:
                            is duppable
                            time_saved = expected_ready - potential_ready
                DUP the duppable task with the greatest `time_saved`
                happens while using a lock meaning that 1 worker can only DUP 1 task at a time
        - [A] Cancelation flag:
            - Set for a duppable task when it's being dupped by another worker
            - also used to TRY to avoid 2 workers from dupping the same task
    [TODO:IMPROVEMENTS]
    - Check if ALL duppable task dependencies are ready before dupping
        replace the current logic that aborts execution if not READY (lazy)
        use `storage.exists(keys[])`
    - BATCH storage operations
    - Use atomic cancelation flag to avoid 2 workers dupping the same task (redis atomic_increment?)
    - On the dashboard, show how many dups happened and where visually
