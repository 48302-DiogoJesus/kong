[GENERIC] Think about the impact of `worker_id` == None
    Allow algorithms to NOT assign worker ids (change `validate` function)
    On the 2 planners, when we short circuit the planning, don't assign worker ids!    
    Create a new planner (similar to WUKONG, with all workers being automatic)
    Experiment with algorithms to not assign workers

[ISSUE]
- Workers are remaining active once again after executing
    cause ?: changes because of supporting "flexible workers"?

[ISSUE]
- Planners predictions are not very accurate with reality!

[PLANNER_OPTIMIZATIONS]
- `pre-warm` (Just make an "empty" invocation (special message that the `Worker Handler` must be ready for?) to a container with a given **resource config**)
    Possible benefits: faster startup times for some tasks on "new" workers
        can't measure it at the planner level since the predictions aren't considering worker startup times (warm/cold)
- `task-dup`
    If a Worker A is waiting for the data of an upstream Task 1 (executing or to be executed on Worker 2 ) to be available, 
    it can execute that task itself. By executing Task 1 locally, Worker 2 wonâ€™t need to wait for the data to be available 
    and then download it from external storage. The results produced by Worker 2 will be ignored by Worker 1. 
    Possible benefits: - makespan ; - data download time.
- Create a planner that uses them + make the prediction calculations take it into account

[REFACTOR]
- Should the worker handler logic be encapsulated in a class?

[PLANNER_NEW_OPTIMIZATION_??] Explore Output Streaming
    - BENEFITS
        - Using pubsub to avoid storing intermediate outputs (when applicable) permanently and save download time (would be same as upload time because as 1 byte gets uploaded, it gets downloaded immediatelly)

[OPTIMIZATION:DATA_ACCESS]
PIPE STORAGE OPERATIONS WHERE POSSIBLE:
- Publishing TASK_READY events, Incrementing DCs
- Downloading input from intermediate storage
- Uploading metrics
[OPTIMIZATION:STORAGE_CLEANUP] Remove intermediate results of a dag after complete (sink task is responsible for this)
    impl => remove storage keys that contain <master_dag_id>
[OPTIMIZATION:STORAGE_USAGE] Task output doesn't always need to go to intermediate storage
[OPTIMIZATION:WORKER_STARTUP_SPEED]
- Storing the full dag on redis is costly (DAG retrieval time adds up)
    - Don't store the whole DAG (figure out how to partition DAG in a way that is correct)
    - If below a certain bytes threshold, pass the subDAG in the invocation itself
        DAGTaskNode.clone() should clone cached_result if below a threshold => then worker checks the DAG received for cached results before downloading from storage
    - Also, DAG size is too big for small code and tasks (35kb for image_transform)
    - Functions with the same name have same code => use a dict[function_name, self.func_code] to save space

[VISUALIZATION:AFTER_DASHBOARD] [!!] Store the plan on storage so that the "Metadata Analysis" dashboard can compare the real results to the plan and draw conclusions

[PLANNING_ALGORITHMS] Dashboard makespan (5 sec) VS client console (9 sec) time big diff.

[VISUALIZATION]
- Update the realtime dashboard to use the same "agrapgh" configuration as the metrics Dashboard
    then, allow clicking on individual tasks to see details (task_id, worker_id, resource config, individual logs)??
    [BUG] (could use the individual task logs to debug this)
    - Sometimes, on some workflows, ALL workers exit and the client doesn't receive the `sink_task_finished_completed` notification
        check if the final result is even produced or if the worker is exiting too early

[EVALUATION:PREPARE]
- Implement **WUKONG** planner
    + optimizations
        - Task Clustering (fan-ins + fan-outs)
        - Delayed I/O
- Implement **Dask** planner
    - just to produce a "Plan" and compare the expected impact of the diff. scheduling decisions for diff. types of workflows

[ERROR_HANDLING]
- Add retry mechanisms
    - On a task level (logic inside a worker)
    - On a worker level (how to report this error if we don't have a centralized Job queue?)
- Redis key to store errors (JSON that stores stderr for each DAG task). Use redis transactions
    Client then should also poll this key periodically

[VERSATILITY]
- Allow user to specify requirements.txt dependencies so that they don't need to be downloaded at runtime
- At the "workflow language", support more levels: e.g., list[list[DAGTaskNode]]
    Find examples where this makes sense (arg: dict[str, DAGTaskNode])
    Find a better way to iterate through them to avoid repetition
- Support for dynamic fan-outs w/ special nodes (re-think implementation to allow chains of dynamic fan-out nodes)

[ROBUSTNESS] Create more tests for more complex and edge case DAG structures + DAG compute tests
